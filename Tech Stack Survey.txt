03.02 Tech Stack Survey

Overview
You can use any tech stack that you wish for the final project. We will conduct a broad survey of languages, backend frameworks, and front-end frameworks that you may want to use. The only restriction is that it must run on EC2 with a Linux image. I have provided a tech stack for you to use if you don't have any preferences. You're free to use it. NOTE: All demo videos in future modules will use the default tech stack.  You are not committing to anything in this assignment; this is just a survey, so you know what is out there. When it comes time to start working on your app you can use the default starter code if you wish.

Task 1 - Research & Compare
Find 3 different full-stack stacks and, for each one, clearly define:

Backend language
Backend framework
Templating system (or frontend rendering approach)
UX/UI framework (Bootstrap, Tailwind, Bulma, Material UI, etc.)
Testing approach (unit/integration/e2e + tool names)
Debugging approach (how you’ll debug + tools)
Your stacks must be meaningfully different (don’t do “Flask vs Django vs FastAPI” as your only differences). Not allowed: Node.js with Express (that stack is provided already). You may use Node.js only if the frameworks differ from the provided starter codeLinks to an external site.. (but it’s safer to avoid Node altogether unless you’re confident your choice is clearly different).

Task 2 - Implement "Hello World"
All major frameworks have plenty of documentation on how to set up a quick "hello world"; some even provide project generators that will construct a new application for you. More obscure frameworks (like using x86 assembly) will require more work to set up and configure. After comparing 3 stacks, pick ONE and create a simple app that includes all of the following:

“Hello World” App Requirements
Your app must demonstrate:

Server runs locally (you can show a terminal screenshot)
One route/page that renders “Hello World”
Uses a templating system (or equivalent server-side rendering)
Uses a UI framework (e.g., Bootstrap) to style the page
Includes one automated test
Demonstrates debugging
example: breakpoint screenshot, debug log output, or short explanation of how you stepped through a request


Tech Stack Options
Below are some ideas for where to get started

Ruby on RailsLinks to an external site.
C# and ASP.NET CoreLinks to an external site.
Python and DjangoLinks to an external site.
Java and SpringLinks to an external site.
GoLinks to an external site. (my personal favorite)
x86 AssemblyLinks to an external site. language  - This option is an instant A+++, assuming you survive the experience.
HTMXLinks to an external site.
PHP with LaravelLinks to an external site.
Complete Examples
Here are some complete examples to get you started. You don't have to pick one of the 5 below you can use anything this is just to help you out if you are struggling to find options.

Stack Option 1: Python / Django

Testing: JUnit + Spring Test
Debugging: IntelliJ/VS Code debugger, logs
Stack Option 3: C# / ASP.NET Core

Task 3 - Post your findings
Use this structure in your discussion post:

Stack 1:
Backend language:
Framework:

Pros/cons (2–3 bullets):
Stack 2:
(same fields)
Stack 3:
(same fields)
Chosen stack to do hello world:
I chose:
Reason (3–5 sentences):
Hello World evidence:

Template/view:
UI framework proof:
Test + results:
Screenshots/Repo link:
Submitting
Create a new discussion post and use the structure above to post your findings.
(optional) Read and respond to other students' posts. This is a great way to find other students to form a team to work on the final project.
